# WordSeparator

This is a program that accepts as input a sentence in which all the words run together, but the first character of each word is uppercase. The sentence was converted into a string in which the words are separated by spaces and only the first word starts with an uppercase letter. Example: "SummerIsTheBestSeason" to "Summer is the best season".
